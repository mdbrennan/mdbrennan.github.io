##About
When I'm not creating amazing font-end code, I spend my time cooking (I'm a keen BBQer), wrestling (I've done BJJ for 7 years), and researching what gadget I *need* to buy next. I have a fish called mike, and live my girlfriend of 3 years.

I also co-founded a startup that was accepted into Australias first start-up incubator program - StartMate beating out over 200 other applicants.

I regularly work on my own projects to both test if an idea is viable, and to sharpen my skills with the latest web technologies.
